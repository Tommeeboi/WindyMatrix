# WindyMatrix
A silly program that was created to organise Football teams fairly

Was originally going to be a website, but made into a simple command-line app for ease of use (and because I couldn't be bothered)

## How To Use
Navigate to the latest release (or click [here](https://github.com/Tommeeboi/releases)) and download the corresponding file:

- Windows: `windyMatrix.exe`
- MacOS: `windyMatrixMac`
- Linux: `windyMatrixLinux` (untested, use at your own risk)

Then simply double-click the file and it SHOULD open up in the terminal

## Source Code
**THIS IS NOT NEEDED IF YOU JUST WANT THE BASE APP**

If the compiled versions don't work for you, or you want to look at/modify the code, then you can download the source code through Code -> Download ZIP

To use the default file, first run `npm i prompt-sync` if you haven't already. Then just `node windyMatrix`

To compile the source code, install pkg (`npm i -g pkg`) then compile with `pkg windyMatrix.js`

**i have no idea what else to put here**
