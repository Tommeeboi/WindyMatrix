# WindyMatrix
A silly website that was created to organise Football teams fairly

Was originally going to be a .exe file but due to compatibility issues it's a website instead. I might compile it with Electron at some point to make it an app though

**i have no idea what else to put here**

Also yes the styling code is terrible because I completely rushed the front-end because it didn't really matter. It all runs and looks fine in the end, I guess
